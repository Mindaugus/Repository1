		<p class="prist">This is me. I was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, a small country in Europe near the Baltic sea. One day, a friend of mine suggested to try out an online course about web development. I liked it a lot, and  it's becoming more and more interesting to me ever since. So I started taking coding academy classes, to take a deeper look how the web development process is done in real life situations. I am highly motivated in further improvement, and I'm open to new challenges and offers. </p>
